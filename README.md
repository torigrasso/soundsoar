# 🎧 SoundSoar

**SoundSoar** is a music trend prediction system that uses Spotify audio features and machine learning to forecast whether a song will become popular. The project began as part of my 2024 data science research and has since evolved into a broader exploration of music analytics and cultural trend modeling.

## 📚 Project Origins (2024 Research)

The original version of SoundSoar was developed as a capstone research project focused on:
- Predicting hit potential using logistic regression, random forest, and XGBoost
- Engineering new features like audio “vibe clusters” and genre embeddings
- Evaluating track popularity trends using Spotify’s Web API and public datasets

This work was presented at the 2025 FLAIRS Conference and demonstrated that engineered audio features can moderately predict a song’s rise in popularity — even across genres.

## 🔮 What’s Next for SoundSoar

The current version of SoundSoar is being reimagined as a multi-phase system with greater depth and flexibility, including:
- Modular pipelines for data collection, audio analysis, and trend modeling
- Exploratory tools for understanding why certain songs go viral
- Visualization dashboards for cultural and industry insights
- A potential interactive frontend for researchers, fans, or educators

This is a living project — new features and documentation will be added regularly as development continues.
